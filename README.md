1)Create a mock API for tasks with endpoints for retrieving all tasks, creating a new task, updating a task, deleting a task, and marking a task as complete. You can use tools like JSONPlaceholder ( https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ ) or create a simple mock server. <b>Done</b><br>
2)Display a list of tasks retrieved from the API.<br>
3)Each task should display its title, description and completion status.<br>
4)Include functionality to mark a task as complete or incomplete. <br>
5)Allow users to add new tasks with a title and description. <b>Done</b><br>
6)Make sure both the title and description are filled in before allowing the user to submit the task.<br>
7)Allow users to edit the title and description of existing tasks. <b>TODO - send the updated version</b><br>
8)Make sure the edited title and description are not empty before allowing the user to save the changes.<br>
9)Provide a way for users to delete a task. Apply a confirmation request before deleting. <b>Done - FrontEnd</b><br>
Use React state and props effectively to manage the state of tasks across components.<br>
Consider using a state management library (eg, Context API or Redux) if the complexity of the application warrants it.<br>
Implement loading states while retrieving data from the API.<br>
Handle errors gracefully, showing meaningful messages to users when API requests fail.
